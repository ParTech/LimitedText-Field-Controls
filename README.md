LimitedText Field Controls
==========================

Description
-----------
This module adds two new field types to the Sitecore Content Editor, *Single-Line Text Limited* and *Multi-Line Text Limited*.
Both controls inherit all functionality from the existing text field controls and add the posibility to configure a maximum allowed value for the field.
The fields inform the user of the number of remaining characters while they are editing.

This comes in extremely handy for field containing a Browser Title or Meta Description, because their length should be kept within the limits of what Google displays in their search results.
